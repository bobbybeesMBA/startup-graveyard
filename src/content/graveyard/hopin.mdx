## The Story

No company embodied the pandemic-era startup frenzy quite like Hopin. Founded in June 2019 by Johnny Boufarhat, a 26-year-old British-Australian entrepreneur who suffered from an autoimmune condition that made attending events in person difficult, Hopin was an online events platform that allowed organizers to host virtual conferences, trade shows, and networking sessions. It was a nice idea before COVID-19. After COVID-19, it was rocket fuel.

When the world locked down in March 2020, the events industry -- a $1.1 trillion global market -- was suddenly, completely, and urgently digital. Hopin was in the right place at the right time with a product that, while imperfect, worked well enough. The platform grew from 5,000 users in March 2020 to over 6 million by the end of the year. Revenue went from essentially zero to over $100 million in annualized run rate within 18 months. Investors tripped over each other to get in. Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, IVP, Tiger Global, and Salesforce Ventures poured in a cumulative $1.6 billion. At its peak valuation of $7.75 billion in August 2021, Hopin was the most valuable startup in Europe.

> "We built a billion-dollar company in a year. Then the world opened up and we had to figure out why anyone would keep using it."

Boufarhat went on an aggressive acquisition spree, spending hundreds of millions to buy companies like StreamYard (a live streaming tool acquired for $250 million), Streamable, Jamm, and Attendify. The strategy was to build a comprehensive "event operating system" that would be indispensable even after the pandemic ended. It was a bet that hybrid events -- part in-person, part virtual -- would become the permanent new normal.

## What Went Wrong

The new normal never materialized. As vaccines rolled out and offices reopened in 2022, the corporate world sprinted back to in-person events with the enthusiasm of a prisoner released from solitary confinement. Virtual conference fatigue was real and deep. Attendees hated the networking features that were supposed to replicate the serendipity of a conference hallway. Sponsors wanted real handshakes, not virtual booths. Event organizers discovered that while virtual events were cheaper to produce, they generated a fraction of the engagement and revenue of their physical counterparts.

Hopin's revenue plummeted. The company that had seemed to print money during lockdown found itself fighting for relevance in a market that was rapidly shrinking back to its pre-pandemic size. The acquisitions that were supposed to provide diversification became anchors. StreamYard was a good product, but it was a tool for live streamers and content creators -- a fundamentally different market than enterprise events. The other acquisitions added complexity without meaningful revenue.

Layoffs came in waves. Hopin cut roughly 40% of its staff in mid-2022, then more in early 2023. Boufarhat stepped down as CEO in early 2023. In a quiet transaction in August 2023, Hopin sold its core events business to RingCentral for an undisclosed sum reported to be a tiny fraction of its peak valuation. StreamYard was spun out as a separate entity. The rest of the acquisitions were wound down. A company valued at $7.75 billion less than two years earlier was effectively dismantled.

## The Lesson

Hopin is a cautionary tale about confusing a temporary surge in demand with a permanent market shift. The pandemic created genuine, urgent need for virtual event technology. But venture investors and founders alike made the mistake of extrapolating that crisis-driven demand into a durable growth curve. When the crisis passed, the demand evaporated. Hopin raised $1.6 billion to dominate a market that was, in large part, a mirage created by extraordinary circumstances. The lesson is not that virtual events are worthless -- they have their place. The lesson is that raising at a $7.75 billion valuation for a product whose primary growth driver is a global catastrophe is a bet that the catastrophe will never end. That is a bad bet.
