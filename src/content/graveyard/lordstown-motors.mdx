## The Story

In the great EV SPAC mania of 2020-2021, when investors were throwing money at anything with a battery and a rendering, Lordstown Motors stood out as one of the most brazen promises of them all. The company was founded in 2019 by Steve Burns, who had previously led the commercial electric vehicle maker Workhorse Group. Burns's pitch was irresistible: he had purchased General Motors' shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio -- the same factory that had built Chevy Cruzes for a generation -- and was going to transform it into the birthplace of the Endurance, an all-electric pickup truck designed for commercial fleet customers.

The symbolism was powerful. A Rust Belt factory, abandoned by a legacy automaker, reborn as the future of American electric vehicles. President Trump visited the facility in 2019. The company claimed to have over 100,000 pre-orders for the Endurance, worth more than $5 billion in future revenue. In October 2020, Lordstown went public via a SPAC merger with DiamondPeak Holdings, raising approximately $675 million at a valuation of $1.6 billion. The stock surged, briefly pushing the company's market cap past $5 billion.

## What Went Wrong

In March 2021, short-seller Hindenburg Research published a devastating report alleging that Lordstown's pre-order book was largely fabricated. The firm claimed that many of the supposed fleet customers had no intention or ability to purchase trucks, that some "orders" were for as few as a single vehicle from entities with no commercial fleets, and that the company's prototype had caught fire ten minutes into its first test drive. Lordstown initially denied the allegations, calling Hindenburg's report "motivated by short sellers."

But the facts caught up. An internal review by a special board committee confirmed that the pre-orders were not what the company had represented them to be. Many were non-binding expressions of interest from individuals or tiny companies, not committed fleet orders from large commercial buyers. CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez resigned in June 2021. The SEC launched a formal investigation, and in July 2023, Burns was charged with securities fraud by the DOJ for allegedly misleading investors about the state of the company's pre-order book.

The Endurance truck itself was perpetually almost ready. The company managed to produce a small number of vehicles -- roughly 35 trucks were built in total before production was halted. Quality issues plagued even this tiny batch. Meanwhile, the company burned through its cash reserves at an alarming rate, spending hundreds of millions on a factory it could never fill with production volume. A deal to sell the factory to Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, provided a brief lifeline but ultimately couldn't save the company.

Lordstown Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2023, then converted to Chapter 7 liquidation. The company sued Foxconn for $170 million, alleging the manufacturer had sabotaged a potential investment. Foxconn countersued. Investors were left with nothing. The Lordstown factory -- the symbol of American manufacturing renewal -- sat idle once again.

## The Lesson

Lordstown Motors is what happens when the SPAC boom meets the EV hype cycle and nobody asks hard questions. Building a car company is one of the most capital-intensive, technically demanding endeavors in all of business. There is a reason the last successful American car startup before Tesla was Chrysler in 1925. Pre-orders are not revenue. Renderings are not vehicles. And a factory is not a product. Lordstown had a great story, a photogenic factory, and a slide deck full of numbers that turned out to be fiction. In the auto industry, the only thing that matters is whether you can build a car that works, at a price people will pay, in volumes that sustain a business. Lordstown could do none of those things.
