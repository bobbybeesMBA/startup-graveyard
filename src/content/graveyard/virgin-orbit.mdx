## The Story

Richard Branson has never met a frontier he didn't want to slap the Virgin logo on, and space was no exception. Virgin Orbit was spun out of Virgin Galactic in 2017 with a novel and genuinely clever approach to launching small satellites: instead of blasting off from a traditional launch pad, its LauncherOne rocket would be carried aloft under the wing of a modified Boeing 747-400 named "Cosmic Girl" and released at 35,000 feet. From there, the rocket would ignite and carry payloads of up to 500 kilograms into low Earth orbit.

The air-launch concept had real technical advantages. It eliminated the need for expensive launch pads, could operate from any airport with a long enough runway, offered flexibility in launch timing and orbital inclination, and avoided weather delays that plague ground launches. The system could theoretically turn any commercial airport into a spaceport. Virgin Orbit raised over $1 billion in funding, including a significant investment when it went public via a SPAC merger in December 2021 at a valuation of roughly $3.2 billion.

> "We could launch from anywhere. The problem was that not enough people needed to launch anything."

The company completed its first successful orbital mission in January 2021, delivering ten NASA cubesats to orbit. It went on to complete three more successful launches, proving the technology worked. In a field littered with rockets that never leave the drawing board, Virgin Orbit actually flew. And it still failed.

## What Went Wrong

The fatal flaw was not technical but commercial. The small satellite launch market that Virgin Orbit was targeting turned out to be far more competitive and far less lucrative than projected. SpaceX's rideshare missions offered small satellite operators a cheap ride to orbit as secondary payloads on Falcon 9 launches, often at a fraction of the cost of a dedicated small launch vehicle. Rocket Lab, with its Electron rocket, had established itself as the reliable, high-cadence option for dedicated small sat launches. Virgin Orbit was stuck in a no-man's land -- more expensive than rideshare, less proven than Rocket Lab.

The company's January 2023 launch from Cornwall, England -- intended to be a triumphant demonstration of the system's airport-anywhere flexibility and the first orbital launch from British soil -- ended in failure when the rocket's upper stage experienced an anomaly and failed to reach orbit. The mission failure was devastating, both technically and financially. With a thin backlog of customers and limited cash reserves, there was no margin for error. The failed launch was a death blow.

Virgin Orbit furloughed nearly all of its roughly 750 employees in March 2023 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. The company's assets -- including Cosmic Girl, launch equipment, and intellectual property -- were auctioned off. Rocket Lab purchased key manufacturing equipment for approximately $16.1 million. Stratolaunch, another air-launch venture, acquired Cosmic Girl for its own programs. The total recovery for creditors was pennies on the dollar. Branson's space ambitions would continue through Virgin Galactic's suborbital tourism business, but the orbital launch company was gone.

## The Lesson

Virgin Orbit proved something important: that a technically sound product is not the same as a viable business. The air-launch system worked. The engineering was real. But the market for dedicated small satellite launches at Virgin Orbit's price point was simply not large enough to sustain a billion-dollar company with aerospace-scale overhead. In the launch industry, where development costs are enormous and launch cadence determines revenue, you need a deep and reliable pipeline of customers before you build the rocket. Virgin Orbit built the rocket first and then discovered the pipeline was a trickle.
