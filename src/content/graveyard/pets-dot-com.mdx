## The Story

If the dot-com bubble had a mascot, it was literal: a sock puppet with button eyes and a microphone, pitching pet supplies from your television set during a Super Bowl commercial that cost $1.2 million. That sock puppet belonged to Pets.com, a company that became the single most iconic symbol of late-1990s internet excess -- a cautionary tale so perfectly packaged that business school professors still teach it a quarter century later.

Pets.com was founded in 1998 by Greg McLemore and launched in August 1999 with a simple premise: buy pet food, toys, and supplies online and have them delivered to your door. Amazon.com invested early, eventually owning 54% of the company. The site launched with enormous fanfare and an advertising blitz that would make a Madison Avenue veteran blush. The sock puppet appeared in People magazine, on Good Morning America, and in a $1.2 million Super Bowl XXXIV ad in January 2000. The puppet was so popular that it briefly became a cultural phenomenon -- Triumph the Insult Comic Dog before Triumph existed. Pets.com went public in February 2000, raising $82.5 million in its IPO. At its peak, the company was valued at over $300 million.

## What Went Wrong

The fundamental problem with Pets.com was so obvious that it's almost embarrassing to explain: pet supplies are heavy, bulky, low-margin products that are expensive to ship. A 40-pound bag of dog food that retails for $15 at a local PetSmart might cost $5-10 to ship to a customer's door. Pets.com was selling products for roughly 27% below cost after shipping, meaning the company lost money on virtually every order. This was not a scaling problem that would resolve with volume -- it was a structural impossibility. More customers meant more losses.

The company attempted to offset these losses with advertising revenue and the hope that customer acquisition costs would decline over time. They did not. Pets.com spent roughly $179 million on marketing and advertising in its brief existence -- a staggering figure for a company that generated only $619,000 in revenue in its first fiscal year and about $5.8 million in its last reported quarter. The customer acquisition cost was estimated at roughly $158 per customer, for customers who might order $50-100 worth of pet supplies per year at negative margins.

By November 2000, just nine months after its IPO and 268 days after that famous Super Bowl ad, Pets.com announced it was shutting down and liquidating its assets. The stock, which had debuted at $11 per share, was trading at 19 cents. The company laid off 255 employees, most of whom were given severance of just a few weeks. The sock puppet -- perhaps the most valuable asset the company ever created -- was sold to BarNone, an auto lending company, which used it in commercials for years afterward. The puppet outlasted the company by a decade.

## The Lesson

Pets.com failed because it ignored the most basic question in commerce: can we sell this product for more than it costs us to deliver it? The company assumed that the internet had changed the fundamental economics of retail. It had not. The internet changed distribution, discovery, and convenience, but it did not change the fact that shipping heavy, low-margin goods to individual homes is expensive. Twenty years later, Chewy.com would prove that online pet supply retail could work -- but only with massive scale, efficient logistics, subscription models, and a willingness to operate on razor-thin margins for years. Pets.com wanted the glory without the grind. The sock puppet was delightful. The business model was not.
