## The Story

In the spring of 2018, electric scooters appeared on the sidewalks of Santa Monica, California, as if dropped from orbit. No one had asked for them. No city had approved them. They were just suddenly there -- hundreds of dockless, app-unlocked scooters scattered across sidewalks and street corners like neon-green breadcrumbs left by a tech billionaire. That billionaire was Travis VanderZanden, a former Lyft COO and Uber VP, who had founded Bird in September 2017 with a simple theory: short-distance urban transportation was broken, and electric scooters could fix it.

The growth was staggering even by Silicon Valley standards. Bird became the fastest company ever to reach a $1 billion valuation, achieving unicorn status in just over a year. Investors piled in: Sequoia Capital, Accel, Index Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Fidelity all wrote checks. By 2019, Bird had raised $776 million and was valued at $2.5 billion. It expanded to over 400 cities across five continents. VanderZanden was hailed as the next great transportation disruptor, a man who would do for short trips what Uber had done for car rides.

## What Went Wrong

The unit economics of e-scooter sharing were brutal from day one, and they never improved enough. Each scooter cost Bird roughly $500-600 to purchase. Early models had an average lifespan of just one to three months in the wild, destroyed by weather, vandalism, theft, and the general indifference of the public to rented property. The company was paying gig workers -- initially called "chargers" and later "mechanics" -- to collect, charge, and redistribute scooters nightly, a logistical nightmare that ate into margins. Factor in insurance, city permitting fees, customer support, and the R&D costs of constantly designing more durable scooters, and the math simply didn't close.

Bird went public via SPAC in November 2021 at a valuation of $2.3 billion. It was, in retrospect, the peak. The stock debuted around $8.40 and began a relentless decline. By September 2022, Bird received a delisting notice from the New York Stock Exchange after its stock price fell below $1. The company reversed-split its stock in a desperate attempt to maintain its listing, but the underlying business was deteriorating rapidly.

Revenue was never the problem -- Bird had plenty of riders. The problem was that revenue could not exceed the staggering cost of operations. Every scooter deployed, charged, maintained, repaired, and eventually replaced was an exercise in value destruction. The company cycled through rounds of layoffs, cutting headcount from over 1,000 to a skeleton crew. It pulled out of dozens of cities. VanderZanden was replaced as CEO in October 2022.

In December 2023, Bird filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its assets were sold to a group of existing creditors for approximately $38 million -- roughly 5% of the capital investors had put in. The scooters that remained on city streets were gradually collected, and another micro-mobility dream was over. Lime, Bird's main rival, survived by merging operations and achieving profitability in some markets, proving that the scooter model could work -- just not the way Bird tried to do it.

## The Lesson

Bird is a case study in the danger of prioritizing growth over sustainability. The company expanded to hundreds of cities before it had proven the economics in even one. It deployed millions of scooters before it had figured out how to make a single scooter profitable over its lifetime. The Silicon Valley playbook of blitzscaling -- grow first, figure out the business model later -- works in software, where the marginal cost of a new user is effectively zero. In hardware-intensive, operationally complex businesses like scooter sharing, every new city and every new scooter is a new cost center. Bird scaled its losses, not its profits.
