## The Story

Quibi might be the most expensive answer to a question nobody asked.

The premise was this: people are glued to their phones, and existing streaming services aren't designed for mobile viewing. What if you created Netflix — but in 10-minute episodes — exclusively for your phone? Jeffrey Katzenberg thought this was a billion-dollar idea. Literally. The former Disney animation chief (who oversaw The Lion King, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast) and later co-founder of DreamWorks, Katzenberg teamed up with Meg Whitman, the former CEO of both eBay and Hewlett-Packard, to build what they called Quibi — short for "quick bites."

They raised $1.75 billion before a single frame of content had been filmed. Read that again. Disney, NBCUniversal, Sony, WarnerMedia, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Alibaba all opened their wallets. The pitch was that potent: Hollywood's most connected dealmaker plus a proven corporate operator, attacking an untapped market in mobile entertainment. The content budget was lavish — up to $6 million per hour of programming, Hollywood-quality production for episodes shorter than most YouTube videos.

Quibi launched on April 6, 2020. It shut down on October 21, 2020. Six months and twelve days. In the annals of startup failure, this is a speedrun.

## What Went Wrong

Start with the timing. Quibi was designed for people on the go — commuters on subways, travelers waiting at gates, anyone with ten minutes to kill between places. It launched three weeks into a global pandemic that confined most of humanity to their couches, where they had access to full-size televisions and every other streaming service in existence. Katzenberg initially blamed COVID for everything.

> "I attribute everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus. Everything."

He later walked that back, but the damage to credibility was done.

The pandemic was the obvious excuse, but Quibi's problems ran far deeper. The fundamental value proposition was broken. People who wanted short-form mobile content already had TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram — for free. People who wanted premium scripted content wanted it on their TVs, in 30-to-60-minute episodes they could lose themselves in. Quibi was trying to sell a premium product at a $5-$8 monthly subscription in a gap in the market that turned out to not actually be a gap at all. It was a seam — and seams exist because the fabric on both sides is already stitched tight.

The product decisions compounded the problem. At launch, you couldn't take screenshots — which meant no memes, no viral sharing, no organic word-of-mouth. In an era where shows blow up on social media before they blow up anywhere else, Quibi built a wall around its content and wondered why nobody was talking about it. You also couldn't cast Quibi to your TV at launch. When your selling point is premium content and your audience is stuck at home staring at their televisions, not letting them watch on their televisions is an astonishing own goal.

The content itself wasn't bad. Some shows earned Emmy nominations. But nothing broke through. Nothing became a water-cooler conversation. In a streaming landscape dominated by "Tiger King" and "The Queen's Gambit," Quibi had nothing that made people feel like they were missing out.

By shutdown, Quibi had approximately 500,000 paying subscribers against a first-year projection of 7.4 million. Only about 8% of users who tried the free trial converted to paying customers. The content library was eventually sold to Roku for under $100 million — a fire sale on nearly $2 billion worth of ambition.

To their credit, Katzenberg and Whitman returned roughly $350 million to investors rather than burning through every last dollar. It was a rare act of capitulatory grace in a world where most founders choose to die on the hill.

## The Lesson

Quibi is a masterclass in the difference between a market gap and a market need. Just because something doesn't exist doesn't mean it should. The two most experienced executives in their respective industries — Hollywood and Silicon Valley — raised nearly $2 billion on the conviction that they saw something the market hadn't. But the market hadn't built mobile-first premium short-form content for a reason: consumers didn't want it. Not at that price point, not in that format, not competing against free alternatives that were already deeply embedded in daily habits. All the money, talent, and resumes in the world can't manufacture demand.
