## The Story

If startup failure is usually a story of good intentions gone wrong, FTX is a reminder that sometimes the intentions were never good to begin with.

Sam Bankman-Fried — "SBF" to the crypto faithful — burst onto the scene as everything the volatile, Wild West cryptocurrency industry seemed to need: a MIT-educated, effective-altruist-philosophizing wunderkind who wore cargo shorts to congressional hearings and pledged to give away his fortune. He founded crypto trading firm Alameda Research in 2017, then launched the FTX exchange in 2019 with co-founder Gary Wang.

FTX grew at a velocity that made even seasoned Silicon Valley observers dizzy. By January 2022, it was valued at $32 billion after raising $400 million in a Series C round. The investor list was staggering: Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, Tiger Global, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Sequoia reportedly wrote an article about SBF on their website titled "Sam Bankman-Fried Has a Savior Complex — And Maybe You Should Too." (They later deleted it.)

Then came the endorsement deals. Tom Brady. Larry David. Steph Curry. Shaquille O'Neal. FTX bought the naming rights to the Miami Heat's arena for $135 million. SBF became a fixture in Washington, making millions in political donations to both parties and testifying before Congress as the "responsible" voice of crypto. At his peak, his net worth was estimated at $26 billion.

## What Went Wrong

On November 2, 2022, CoinDesk published a single article that detonated the entire empire. The report revealed that Alameda Research's balance sheet was built overwhelmingly on FTT — a token created by its sister company, FTX. In plain English: Alameda's "assets" were largely made-up money printed by a related entity. The whole structure was circular.

What followed was a bank run in fast-forward. Rival exchange Binance announced it would dump its FTT holdings. Customers stampeded for the exits. FTX couldn't meet withdrawals because — as the world would soon learn — there was an $8 billion hole where customer deposits should have been.

Where did the money go? Into Alameda Research. FTX's code had been secretly modified to give Alameda a special exemption, essentially a blank check to withdraw unlimited customer funds. Those funds were used for risky trades, venture investments, luxury real estate in the Bahamas, and millions in political donations. A group of twentysomethings living together in a Bahamian penthouse had been playing with other people's money like it was a video game — because to them, it essentially was.

FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. The new CEO brought in to sort through the wreckage was John J. Ray III, the same man who had unwound Enron. He called FTX's corporate controls a "complete failure" and said it was the worst case of mismanagement he had ever seen. From the man who cleaned up Enron, that is a damning superlative.

SBF was arrested in the Bahamas in December 2022, extradited to the United States, and convicted in November 2023 of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. He was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. His three closest co-conspirators — Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh — all pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors, testifying that SBF personally directed them to commit fraud.

## The Lesson

FTX is not really a startup failure story. It's a crime story. But the failure around it — the failure of due diligence, of regulation, of the media, of every investor who handed this company billions without apparently checking whether customer funds were being safeguarded — is the real cautionary tale. Sequoia, SoftBank, and Tiger Global all wrote their investments down to zero. The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan lost $95 million of Canadian retirees' money. Tom Brady is being sued. When an industry celebrates a self-proclaimed genius who refuses adult supervision, it shouldn't be surprised when the adults eventually have to step in with handcuffs.
