## The Story

Domm Holland was a big personality. The Australian-born founder of Fast was loud, charismatic, and extremely online — a prolific tweeter who cultivated a personal brand as a swashbuckling founder taking on Amazon's one-click checkout patent. His pitch was that every online store deserved frictionless one-click purchasing, and Fast would be the universal checkout button for the internet. He described the opportunity as "bigger than Stripe."

In a world where cart abandonment rates hover around 70%, the pitch made intuitive sense. Investors agreed. Fast raised $20 million in a Series A in 2020 led by Index Ventures, then a staggering $102 million Series B in January 2021 led by Stripe itself, with Addition (Lee Fixel's fund) also participating. Total funding: $124.5 million. The company's estimated valuation approached $580 million.

Holland lived large. Fast's San Francisco offices were sleek. The company sponsored a NASCAR driver. It hired aggressively, growing to around 400 employees at its peak. Holland was everywhere — on podcasts, on Twitter, at conferences — selling the vision of Fast as the next great infrastructure layer of the internet.

## What Went Wrong

Fast had almost no revenue. By some reports, the company was generating just $600,000 in annual revenue at the time of its Series B — against a burn rate of roughly $10 million per month. That means Fast was spending approximately $10 million for every $50,000 it earned. The math was not mathing.

The product itself had problems. One-click checkout sounds transformative, but the market was more crowded and less desperate for a solution than Holland's pitch suggested. Shopify had Shop Pay. Amazon owned one-click (and had only recently let the patent expire). Apple Pay and Google Pay handled mobile checkout. Bolt, a direct competitor, had a significant head start. Fast's product reportedly had reliability issues, and merchants found it difficult to integrate.

Meanwhile, the spending was breathtaking. Four hundred employees for a company with negligible revenue. A NASCAR sponsorship. A San Francisco headquarters. Holland's compensation and the company's operating expenses were wildly disconnected from the underlying business reality.

> "Fast had the budget of a company doing $100 million in revenue and the revenue of a lemonade stand."

In March 2022, barely a year after the $102 million raise, Fast laid off the majority of its staff. A week later, on April 4, Holland posted a tweet: "I have some bad news to share. Unfortunately, Fast is shutting down." Employees described the announcement as abrupt and chaotic. Some learned they'd lost their jobs from Twitter before the company told them directly.

Stripe, which had both invested in Fast and served as its payment processor, attempted to help find an acquirer but was unsuccessful. The $124.5 million was gone. The NASCAR car would need a new sponsor.

## The Lesson

Fast is the story of what happens when founder charisma and investor FOMO completely decouple from business fundamentals. A checkout button is a feature, not a company — and in a market where Shopify, Apple, and Google already offer streamlined checkout, the barrier to adoption is not technology but merchant inertia. You cannot overcome that inertia by spending $10 million a month, hiring 400 people, and sponsoring a race car.

The more uncomfortable lesson is about investor responsibility. Stripe invested $102 million in a company doing $600,000 in revenue. At some point, writing checks is not "betting on the founder" — it's writing fan fiction with other people's money. Fast's collapse took 400 jobs with it and left nothing behind but a cautionary tweet thread.
