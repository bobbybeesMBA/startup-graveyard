## The Story

The pitch for MoviePass was so simple it sounded like a joke: pay $9.95 a month and see one movie a day in theaters. Any movie. Any theater. Every day. At a time when a single movie ticket in most American cities cost $12-15, the math didn't work on its face. But that was supposed to be the point -- MoviePass wasn't really in the movie ticket business, according to its leadership. It was in the data business. The subscription was a loss leader, a way to amass millions of users whose moviegoing habits could be monetized through advertising, partnerships, and analytics.

MoviePass was originally founded in 2011 by Stacy Spikes and Hamet Watt as a modest subscription service with plans starting around $30-50 per month. At that price, the economics were tight but survivable. The company puttered along with a few tens of thousands of subscribers until 2017, when Helios and Matheson Analytics -- a small, publicly traded data analytics firm led by Ted Farnsworth -- acquired a majority stake and installed Mitch Lowe, a Netflix co-founder, as CEO. Lowe and Farnsworth immediately slashed the price to $9.95 per month with no daily limits. It was the startup equivalent of lighting money on fire in Times Square and calling it a marketing strategy.

> "We were losing money on every single transaction, and our plan was to make it up on volume. That is not how math works."

The gambit worked -- as marketing. Subscribers exploded from 20,000 to over 3 million in less than a year. MoviePass became a cultural phenomenon, the talk of every dinner party, the subject of breathless media coverage. The problem was that each of those 3 million subscribers was a hemorrhaging wound. MoviePass was paying full retail price for every ticket -- buying them from theaters at $12-15 and selling them to subscribers for effectively pennies per viewing. The more popular the service got, the faster it died.

## What Went Wrong

By summer 2018, MoviePass was burning through $20-40 million per month. The company's stock, which had once traded at over $30 per share (pre-reverse-split), cratered below 10 cents. In a moment that perfectly encapsulated the desperation, MoviePass literally ran out of money to pay for tickets in July 2018, leaving subscribers stranded at box offices with declined cards. The company had to take out an emergency $5 million loan just to turn the service back on.

What followed was a frantic series of restrictions that gutted the original value proposition. Surge pricing. Blackout dates on popular films. A limit of three movies per month. Then only certain movies on certain days. Subscribers fled as fast as they had arrived. The service that had gone from 20,000 to 3 million users accomplished the reverse trip even faster.

Investigations followed. In 2020, Mitch Lowe admitted in a public presentation that MoviePass had secretly changed subscribers' passwords to lock out heavy users -- a practice he casually described as targeting people who were "seeing too many movies." The FTC launched an investigation and, in 2021, settled with MoviePass over charges of deceptive practices. Helios and Matheson filed for bankruptcy. Ted Farnsworth and Mitch Lowe faced securities fraud charges from the DOJ in 2022. Original founder Stacy Spikes bought back the brand and attempted a relaunch in 2022, but the name was too tainted to resurrect at meaningful scale.

## The Lesson

MoviePass is the purest distillation of a particular Silicon Valley delusion: the belief that if you acquire users fast enough, the business model will somehow materialize. But a business model is not a thing that appears when you reach sufficient scale. It is the thing you need before you scale. MoviePass had millions of users, cultural relevance, and a product that people genuinely loved. It had everything except a way to not lose money on every single customer interaction. That turned out to be kind of important.
