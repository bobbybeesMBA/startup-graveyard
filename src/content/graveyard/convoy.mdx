## The Story

Every decade or so, someone looks at the American trucking industry — an $800 billion behemoth held together by phone calls, fax machines, and handshake deals — and says, "What if we built an app for that?"

In 2015, two former Amazon employees thought they had the answer. Dan Lewis and Grant Goodale founded Convoy in Seattle with a pitch that made venture capitalists salivate: a digital freight network that would match shippers with truck drivers using algorithms instead of brokers. Think Uber, but for eighteen-wheelers. The investor deck practically wrote itself.

And write itself it did — straight to the bank. Convoy raised money from a murderer's row of backers that read like a Forbes 400 guest list: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Bono (yes, the U2 frontman apparently had thoughts on intermodal freight). By April 2022, the company had pulled in $260 million at a staggering $3.8 billion valuation. Total lifetime funding approached $900 million. For a freight brokerage. Let that sink in.

## What Went Wrong

The core problem was one that no amount of Silicon Valley optimism could algorithm away: freight brokerage is a brutally low-margin business. Traditional brokers operate on margins of 10-15%, and they do it with decades of relationships, institutional knowledge, and operating discipline. Convoy was trying to out-spend incumbents like C.H. Robinson in a market where the product — moving boxes from A to B — is fundamentally commoditized.

During the pandemic boom of 2020-2021, when shipping rates spiked and everyone needed trucks yesterday, Convoy looked like a genius bet. Revenue soared. Drivers flocked to the platform. But when the freight market reversed hard in 2022, the company found itself "running up the down escalator," as CEO Dan Lewis would later describe it. Monthly losses hit $10 million. Round after round of layoffs followed — from a peak of 1,500 employees down to 500, then to zero.

The company spent four months desperately searching for a buyer. In the end, Flexport acquired Convoy's technology assets for $16 million — roughly 2% of the nearly $1 billion investors had poured in. Employees on their last day received no severance and were told their stock options were worthless. Small trucking operators who had built their businesses around Convoy's platform were left holding tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid invoices. One Milwaukee owner-operator was left with $32,000 in unpaid loads. A Kent, Washington driver named Angadjot Sandhu, who had grown from one truck to five on the strength of Convoy loads, had to let drivers go and still hasn't recovered.

The cruelest irony? Convoy's stated mission was to empower small trucking businesses. In the end, its collapse hurt them most.

## The Lesson

Technology can optimize a market, but it cannot rewrite its fundamental economics. Freight brokerage margins are thin for a reason — the service is commoditized and the barriers to entry are low. Pouring $900 million in venture capital onto a low-margin business doesn't build a moat. It builds a bonfire. And when the market turns, you find out whether you have a real business or an expensive science experiment subsidized by other people's money. Convoy learned it was the latter.
