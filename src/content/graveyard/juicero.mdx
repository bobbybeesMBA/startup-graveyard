## The Story

Every era of Silicon Valley excess produces its perfect mascot. For the dot-com era, it was Pets.com's sock puppet. For the ZIRP era of 2021, it was an NFT of a bored ape. For the mid-2010s "we'll put a chip in everything" moment, it was Juicero -- a $700, Wi-Fi-connected, QR-code-scanning juice press that was rendered completely obsolete by the human hand.

Doug Evans founded Juicero in 2013 after a personal health transformation led him to raw juice evangelism. He wasn't modest about the mission: Evans compared himself to Steve Jobs and his juice press to the first Tesla Roadster. He spent 1,200 days developing 12 prototypes before landing on the Juicero Press, a gleaming countertop machine that looked like an iMac designed to squeeze fruit. Which is essentially what it was.

The machine worked with proprietary single-serving pouches of pre-chopped organic fruits and vegetables, sold on subscription for $5-$8 per pack. You placed the pouch in the machine, it scanned the QR code to verify freshness (wouldn't want expired kale, after all), connected to Wi-Fi (naturally), and applied four tons of pressing force to extract juice. Evans bragged the press could "lift two Teslas." An engineer who later disassembled the device found 400 custom parts and described it as "an incredibly complicated piece of engineering" -- born from a design process that never had to worry about cost because it had $120 million in venture capital.

Google Ventures led the funding. Kleiner Perkins invested. Campbell Soup invested. Even Oprah endorsed the product. At launch in March 2016, the press cost $699.

## What Went Wrong

On April 19, 2017, Bloomberg reporters Ellen Huet and Olivia Zaleski published a story with a one-minute video that detonated Juicero's entire reason for existing. The experiment was simple: they squeezed a Juicero pouch by hand. And got just as much juice as the $700 machine produced. In some cases, the hand-squeezing was actually faster.

The video went viral. The internet had a field day. Juicero became an instant punchline -- the definitive symbol of Silicon Valley solving problems that didn't exist, with engineering that nobody needed, funded by investors who apparently never thought to squeeze the bag themselves.

Juicero's new CEO, Jeff Dunn (former president of Coca-Cola, brought in after the board ousted Evans), published a defensive blog post calling hand-squeezing "hacking" that created "mess" and a "poor user experience." This did not help. The company slashed the price to $399. It did not help. It was losing $4 million per month. A $55 million investment round fell apart.

By September 2017, sixteen months after launch, Juicero announced it was suspending operations, buying back machines from customers, and seeking a buyer. None materialized. One hundred and twenty million dollars, atomized.

## The Lesson

Juicero is the purest parable of solution in search of a problem. The juice was apparently delicious. The pouches were genuinely innovative -- a clever, mess-free way to get fresh cold-pressed juice at home. If Juicero had just sold the pouches, they might have built a real business. Instead, they wrapped a simple food product in $120 million worth of unnecessary technology, DRM-style lockout mechanisms, and an internet-connected supply chain, then priced it for the only demographic that could afford it: the exact Silicon Valley bubble residents who funded it.

The deeper lesson is about investor blind spots. Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins wrote enormous checks to a juice company without, apparently, ever asking: "What happens if someone just squeezes the bag?" Due diligence is not just about the financials. Sometimes it's about the physics.
