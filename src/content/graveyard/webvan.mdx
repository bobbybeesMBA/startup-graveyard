## The Story

Before Instacart, before Amazon Fresh, before your neighbor started an "artisanal meal kit" delivery service out of their garage, there was Webvan -- the original attempt to put a supermarket on the internet. And for a brief, manic moment at the peak of the dot-com bubble, it looked like the future.

Webvan was the brainchild of Louis Borders, who had already co-founded the Borders bookstore chain (itself a cautionary tale for another day). His pitch in 1996 was ahead of its time by at least 15 years: order groceries online, and they'd arrive at your door within a 30-minute window of your choosing. No lines, no parking lots, no fighting over the last avocado. To make this work, Borders envisioned a network of massive automated fulfillment centers -- 330,000-square-foot robotic warehouses with five miles of conveyor belts, refrigerated zones, and proprietary picking systems. He signed a $1 billion contract with engineering giant Bechtel to build them across 26 American cities. Before proving the model worked in even one.

The investors came running. Sequoia Capital, Benchmark, SoftBank, Goldman Sachs, even Yahoo. By the time Webvan launched operations in 1999, it had already banked nearly $400 million in venture capital. Then came the IPO in November 1999: the stock doubled on its first day of trading, giving the company an $8.5 billion valuation. At that point, Webvan had reported cumulative revenue of $395,000. Less than four hundred thousand dollars. Against hundreds of millions in spending.

To lead this rocket ship, Borders recruited George Shaheen, the CEO of Andersen Consulting (now Accenture), away from his $4 million annual salary. Shaheen's deal included a provision guaranteeing him $375,000 per year for life. He is reportedly still collecting it.

## What Went Wrong

The strategy was "Get Big Fast" -- the three most dangerous words in dot-com-era English. None of Webvan's senior executives had grocery industry experience. They were technologists and consultants building the most elaborate grocery delivery infrastructure ever conceived, without first answering the most basic question: can this business make money on a single order?

It could not. Grocery is a 1-2% margin business even for Walmart. Webvan was delivering those groceries to individual homes in custom time windows using branded vans and a workforce that would put them neatly in your refrigerator while wearing booties. Each $35 order cost the company far more than $35 to fulfill. The plan assumed that scale would eventually fix the unit economics. It did not.

Meanwhile, the company was expanding into ten cities simultaneously, building a new $35 million warehouse in each one, before the Bay Area operation -- the first and most mature -- had shown any path to profitability. Mike Moritz, the legendary Sequoia partner on Webvan's board, would later admit the company "committed the cardinal sin of retail, which is to expand into a new territory before we had demonstrated success in the first market. In fact, we were busy demonstrating failure in the Bay Area while we expanded into other regions."

When the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the capital spigot shut off. Webvan's stock fell from $15 to six cents. The company burned through over $1 billion and laid off 2,000 employees. In July 2001, the board voted to shut it down. The warehouses, the vans, the five-mile conveyor belts -- all auctioned off.

The supreme irony: the idea was right. Amazon later hired former Webvan executives to build Amazon Fresh, bought the robotics company KIVA Systems (whose technology descended from Webvan's automated warehouses) for $775 million, and even owns the domain webvan.com. The vision just needed 15 more years of infrastructure, consumer readiness, and vastly cheaper technology to actually work.

## The Lesson

Webvan is the ur-story of premature scaling. The concept was visionary -- Instacart, Amazon Fresh, and every pandemic grocery delivery surge proved that. But building the infrastructure for 26 cities while losing money in the first one is not ambition. It's arson. The dot-com era mantra of "Get Big Fast" assumed that growth was itself a strategy. Webvan proved that growth without unit economics is just a more expensive way to go bankrupt. If your model doesn't work at one warehouse, it won't work at twenty-six.
