## The Story

Three guys in Canada wanted to sell snowboards online. Simple enough. Except when they went looking for e-commerce software to build their store, everything on the market was terrible. Clunky, ugly, painful to use. So one of them, a programmer named Tobias, built his own storefront from scratch.

The snowboard shop itself was a dud. Barely anyone bought boards from Snowdevil. But the store they built? That was clean, intuitive, and actually pleasant to use. They started getting emails: "Hey, we don't care about your snowboards, but can we use your store software?"

Light bulb moment. They killed the snowboard shop and started selling the storefront instead. Today, that storefront powers over four million online businesses and the company is worth roughly $100 billion. The founders never did make it as snowboard moguls. They made it as the people who made *everyone else* a mogul.
