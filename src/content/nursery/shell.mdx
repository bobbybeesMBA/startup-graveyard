## The Story

In 1833, a shopkeeper in London's East End opened a modest business selling an unusual product: seashells. Decorative, polished, exotic shells imported from the Far East, sold to Victorian collectors and curiosity seekers. The shop also dealt in antiques and oriental novelties. It was quaint and small and the logo — a scallop shell — perfectly fit the merchandise.

The shopkeeper's sons inherited the business and expanded into general import/export trading across Asia. Then, in the 1890s, they spotted a much bigger opportunity: oil. Specifically, transporting oil from the Caspian Sea and the Dutch East Indies to markets in Asia and Europe. They commissioned the world's first purpose-built oil tanker and began shipping kerosene through the Suez Canal.

The seashell shop became one of the largest energy companies on Earth, eventually merging with Royal Dutch Petroleum to form a globe-spanning oil conglomerate. The scallop shell logo — originally representing actual seashells in a London curiosity shop — became one of the most recognized corporate symbols in the world, now seen on gas stations across six continents. They kept the shell. They just stopped selling them.
