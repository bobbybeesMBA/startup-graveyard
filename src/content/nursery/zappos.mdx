## The Story

In 1999, a guy named Nick walked into shoe stores around his town, took photos of the shoes on the shelves, and posted them on a website. When someone placed an order online, he'd drive back to the store, buy the shoes at full retail price, and ship them to the customer. He lost money on literally every sale.

This was not a viable business model. This was barely a business at all. It was a man with a camera and a website testing a single hypothesis: will people buy shoes on the internet without trying them on first?

They would. Orders trickled in, then flowed, then flooded. The photos-from-the-store phase gave way to actual wholesale relationships, then distribution centers, then a legendary customer service operation that once had an employee on a support call for over 10 hours.

The company built its entire culture around one insight: people will buy shoes online if you make returns painless. Free shipping both ways. 365-day return policy. Call center reps who were empowered to do whatever it took to make customers happy. Amazon bought the company for $1.2 billion in 2009. All because a guy was willing to lose money driving to shoe stores with a digital camera, just to prove people would click "buy."
