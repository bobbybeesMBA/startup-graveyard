## The Story

The original pitch deck from April 2004 shows something that looks nothing like a phone. It shows a digital camera connected — wired or wireless — to a home computer, which then links to a cloud datacenter. The idea was an operating system for smart cameras that would store your photos online automatically.

The founders were camera nerds building for camera nerds. But as they were shopping the concept to investors, they realized the digital camera market was small and shrinking — phones were starting to absorb camera functionality. The much bigger opportunity was building an operating system for the devices everyone was about to carry in their pockets.

So the camera OS became a phone OS. Google acquired it for $50 million in 2005, and the rest is mobile computing history. The operating system that was designed to help you upload photos from your Canon now powers over 3 billion active devices worldwide. The camera pivot turned out to be one of the most consequential redirections in tech history.
