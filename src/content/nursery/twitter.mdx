## The Story

Once upon a time there was a perfectly reasonable podcasting company called Odeo. It had funding. It had a team. It had a product that let people discover and subscribe to podcasts. The year was 2005, and podcasting was heating up.

Then Apple announced that iTunes would natively support podcasts. In one keynote, Steve Jobs vaporized Odeo's entire reason to exist.

With a dead product and investor money in the bank, the founders gave their employees two weeks to brainstorm new ideas in a series of hackathons. During one of these sessions, a quiet engineer named Jack Dorsey pitched an idea so small it almost got ignored: what if you could text a short "status update" to a group of friends? What you're doing. What you're thinking. 140 characters, max.

They called it "twttr" (vowels were optional in 2006). The internal prototype was meant for Odeo employees to message each other. It exploded at South by Southwest in 2007, jumping from 20,000 tweets a day to 60,000 during the conference. The podcasting company was dead. The accidental status update app became the town square of the internet.
