## The Story

After World War II, a mechanically gifted Italian named Ferruccio came home and started building tractors out of leftover military machinery. Engines from abandoned tanks, transmissions from decommissioned trucks — he could turn scrap metal into farming equipment. Business boomed. By the early 1960s, he was one of Italy's most successful agricultural equipment manufacturers and very, very rich.

Rich enough to buy Ferraris. He owned several. And he had a complaint: the clutch kept breaking. When he inspected it, he realized Ferrari was using the same clutch component as one of his tractors. Offended, he drove to Maranello and told Enzo Ferrari himself that his cars had a lousy clutch. Enzo reportedly told him to go back to building tractors and leave sports cars to the experts.

So Ferruccio went home, hired a team of engineers, and built his own sports car — specifically to prove Enzo wrong. The first model debuted in 1963. Today, you can still find rusting 1950s tractors with this family name on them in the Italian countryside. But when most people hear the name, they think of something considerably faster. Spite, it turns out, is an underrated business strategy.
