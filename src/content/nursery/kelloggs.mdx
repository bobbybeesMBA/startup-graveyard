## The Story

A physician running a health sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan, in the 1890s had very specific beliefs about diet and morality. He was convinced that spicy, flavorful food stimulated sinful desires — particularly of the, let's say, *solitary* variety. His solution: create the blandest possible breakfast food. Something so aggressively flavorless that it would calm the body's baser impulses before the day even started.

He developed a recipe for twice-baked wheat dough — intentionally boring, intentionally dry. Then came the accident. One night, a batch of wheat dough was left out and fermented. When they ran it through the rollers the next morning, instead of a sheet of dough, they got thin, crispy flakes. They baked the flakes and tasted them. Not bad, actually.

His brother saw commercial potential and wanted to add sugar. The doctor was horrified — sugar would defeat the entire anti-desire purpose. The brothers fought bitterly. The commercially minded brother eventually won, added sugar, switched from wheat to corn, and started selling the product nationally. The breakfast cereal industry was born from a family feud over whether food should taste good.

Today, the company sells billions of dollars worth of cereal, snacks, and frozen foods across 180 countries. The original moral purpose has been thoroughly lost — Frosted Flakes are not, by any reasonable standard, suppressing anyone's appetites for anything. But the soggy accident in a Michigan sanitarium kitchen changed how the entire world eats breakfast.
