## The Story

The first version was a mobile shopping app that let you browse catalogs from your favorite retailers and buy stuff with a few taps. The founders thought mobile commerce was the future (they were right, eventually). But in 2009, mobile payments were clunky, conversion rates were abysmal, and almost nobody was actually buying anything through the app.

What people *were* doing was collecting. Saving products. Making lists. Curating boards of things they liked — not to buy, but to admire, compare, and share. The founders saw an entire behavior pattern hiding in their failed shopping app: people loved organizing things visually. They loved "pinning" things they found beautiful or aspirational.

So they stripped out the commerce, kept the curation, and rebuilt around the idea of visual discovery boards. Users could pin anything from the internet — recipes, outfits, furniture, travel destinations — to themed boards they could share with friends. The shopping app that nobody shopped on became one of the most powerful visual discovery platforms on the internet, now worth over $20 billion. Your mom's recipe board started as a failed retail app.
