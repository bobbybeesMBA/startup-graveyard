## The Story

In 1886, a traveling salesman walked the streets of upstate New York selling books. He was not particularly good at selling books. But he'd figured out a trick: if he gave the women who answered the door a small vial of perfume as a free gift, they were much more likely to listen to his pitch. Some even invited him inside.

Then he noticed something that should have been obvious: the women didn't care about the books. They wanted the perfume. They asked about the perfume. They told their friends about the perfume. The books were dead weight he was hauling up porches as a pretense for the free sample.

So he dropped the books entirely and started selling fragrances, face creams, and cosmetics, delivered directly to customers through a network of local representatives — mostly women selling to women in their own communities. The door-to-door model stayed. The books didn't. A failed literary venture became one of the world's largest beauty companies, with millions of representatives in over 100 countries. All because a book salesman had the humility to notice which product people actually wanted.
