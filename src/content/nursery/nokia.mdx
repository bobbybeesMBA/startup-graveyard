## The Story

In 1865, a Finnish engineer built a paper mill on a riverbank. Down the road, another company started manufacturing rubber boots and galoshes — essential gear for Finnish winters. A third factory made electrical cables. In 1967, all three merged into a single conglomerate named after the town where the paper mill sat.

For decades, the combined company was a grab-bag of Finnish industrial products: paper, rubber, cables, tires, televisions, even toilet paper. It was boring and profitable and utterly unknown outside Scandinavia.

Then in the early 1980s, the company's cable division started experimenting with something new: radio telephones. The first models were designed for the military and emergency services — brick-sized devices bolted into cars. But as mobile network technology developed through the 1980s and 1990s, the company leaned in hard. It sold off the rubber boots, the paper, the toilet paper. By the late 1990s, it was the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, famous for devices so indestructible they became a meme decades later.

The paper mill and boot factory became the company that put a phone in every pocket on Earth — at least until a certain fruit-themed competitor came along. Even then, the pivot didn't stop: today the company makes telecom network equipment, having sold its phone business to Microsoft (which promptly drove it into the ground). From paper to boots to cables to phones to networks. Five pivots across 160 years. The Finnish way.
