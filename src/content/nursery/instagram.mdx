## The Story

A guy named Kevin was teaching himself to code as a side project. He built a cluttered little app called Burbn (yes, named after bourbon) that let you check in to locations, make plans with friends, earn points, and — oh yeah — post photos. It was trying to be Foursquare, a social calendar, and a photo feed all at once. It was a mess.

But Kevin noticed something in the usage data that changed everything: nobody was checking in. Nobody was making plans. Everyone was just posting photos. The one feature he'd barely thought about was the only one people actually cared about.

So he and his co-founder stripped Burbn down to its bones. They deleted check-ins, plans, and points. They kept photos, added filters (because 2010-era phone cameras were garbage), and relaunched under a new name. It hit a million users in two months. Facebook bought it for $1 billion two years later. The bourbon check-in app died so your brunch photos could live.
