## The Story

In 1946, a 23-year-old Marine veteran opened a hot dog stand in San Bernardino, California. It was a straightforward operation — wieners and buns on a busy road. He watched the cars go by and fed the drivers.

But San Bernardino in the late 1940s was also home to a growing Mexican-American community, and the hot dog man started noticing long lines at a local Mexican restaurant. He was intrigued. He started experimenting with tacos at his stand — crunchy-shelled, ground beef, cheap, fast. The customers responded. The hot dogs faded into the background.

He opened his first dedicated Mexican-food restaurant in 1962 in Downey, California, naming it after himself. The concept was simple: take Mexican-inspired food, streamline it for speed and consistency, and price it so a teenager with pocket change could eat a full meal. No frills, no pretension, just fast tacos.

Today, the chain has over 8,000 locations worldwide and has invented things like the Doritos Locos Taco and the Crunchwrap Supreme — foods that would probably mystify an actual Mexican grandmother but that have brought a particular kind of late-night joy to millions. It all started because a hot dog vendor was curious about the line at the taco place next door.
