## The Story

It started with cryptography for handheld devices. Two guys — one obsessed with math, one obsessed with libertarian philosophy — met after a Stanford lecture and decided to build encrypted transfers between Palm Pilots. The product was called Confinity, and it let you literally hold two Palm Pilots facing each other and "beam" an IOU via infrared.

The problem was obvious in retrospect: almost nobody owned a Palm Pilot, and the ones who did weren't beaming IOUs at each other. The team realized the underlying idea — sending money digitally between two people — was strong, but the delivery mechanism was absurd. So they pivoted to email. You could now send money to anyone with an email address.

This happened to coincide with the rise of a certain online auction site where millions of strangers were buying and selling stuff and desperately needed a way to pay each other. The Palm Pilot payment beamer became the payment backbone of the internet. eBay acquired it for $1.5 billion in 2002. One of those two original founders went on to start a few small ventures: SpaceX, Tesla, and some other stuff.
