## The Story

In the early 1960s, a New England textile company was slowly dying. Founded in the 1800s, it had spent over a century manufacturing cotton fabric, primarily linings for men's suits. The American textile industry was being gutted by cheaper foreign competition, and this company was losing money with depressing consistency.

A young investor from Omaha, Nebraska, started buying shares. His original plan was a quick arbitrage — buy cheap, sell when the company did a stock buyback, pocket the difference. Clean and simple. Then the company's CEO offered him a slightly lower buyback price than promised. The investor was so irritated by this perceived slight that he decided to buy the entire company instead, just to fire the CEO.

He later called this decision the worst investment of his career. The textile business continued hemorrhaging money. But rather than shut it down, the investor used the corporate shell as a vehicle for something else entirely: buying other businesses. Insurance companies first, then banks, then railroads, then consumer brands.

The suit lining factory became the holding company of the most successful investor in history. Today it owns GEICO, Dairy Queen, Duracell, BNSF Railway, and stakes in Apple, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America. It's worth over $900 billion. All because a Nebraska investor got annoyed about a stock buyback and bought a failing cotton mill out of spite. Like the tractor-to-supercar story, it turns out that pettiness is an underrated engine of capitalism.
