## The Story

For most of the 20th century, this was a playing card company based in Kyoto, Japan. Founded in 1889, it dominated the Japanese card market for decades. Hanafuda cards, Western-style poker decks, you name it. By the 1960s, the company was the largest card-game manufacturer in Japan.

Then the chairman, a restless entrepreneur named Hiroshi Yamauchi, got bored and went on what can only be described as a corporate identity crisis. He tried everything. The company launched a taxi service. It opened a chain of short-stay "love hotels" (yes, exactly what you think). It made instant rice. It operated a TV network. It even experimented with a vacuum cleaner. All of it flopped or fizzled.

Then in the 1970s, Yamauchi noticed the emerging electronic toy market. He hired a young industrial designer to create simple electronic games. That designer, Gunpei Yokoi, built a toy called the Ultra Hand. Then Game & Watch. Then a little arcade game about a carpenter rescuing his girlfriend from a barrel-throwing ape.

The playing card company that tried being a taxi service and a love hotel empire is now worth over $60 billion and is responsible for Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, and the Switch. Every time you pick up a controller, you're holding the legacy of a company that once tried to monetize hourly room rentals.
