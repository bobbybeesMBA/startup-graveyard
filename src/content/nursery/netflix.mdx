## The Story

The legend goes that the founder got hit with a $40 late fee from Blockbuster for a VHS copy of Apollo 13, and it made him so angry he started a company to destroy them. (The founder later admitted this was a bit embellished, but it's too good a story to let facts get in the way.)

The original product in 1997 was genuinely weird: a website where you picked DVDs, and they arrived in your mailbox in little red envelopes. When you were done, you mailed them back. No late fees, no driving to a store, no judgmental looks when you rented The Notebook for the third time. The subscription model — unlimited DVDs for a flat monthly rate — was the real innovation, but it was still a physical logistics operation. Warehouses full of discs, postal routes, envelope engineering.

The first pivot was to streaming in 2007 — delivering movies over the internet instead of through the mail. But the real pivot, the one that turned a mail-order service into a cultural superpower, was the decision to make original content. House of Cards in 2013 proved that the DVD mailman could produce prestige television. Blockbuster, which had famously turned down a chance to buy the company for $50 million, filed for bankruptcy. The $40 late fee never stood a chance.
