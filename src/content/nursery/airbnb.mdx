## The Story

Two broke design school graduates in San Francisco couldn't make rent. A design conference was coming to town and every hotel was booked. So they bought three air mattresses, threw up a simple website called AirBed & Breakfast, and offered conference attendees a spot on their living room floor for $80 a night. Breakfast included.

Three people actually booked. The founders realized there might be something here — not air mattresses specifically, but the broader idea that people would pay to stay in someone's home instead of a hotel. Their initial versions were janky. At one point, to keep the company alive during a funding drought, they designed and sold limited-edition cereal boxes — "Obama O's" and "Cap'n McCain's" — during the 2008 presidential election. They made $30,000 on cereal. Cereal.

Y Combinator eventually accepted them, and the rest is hospitality history. The air mattress company that sold political cereal boxes to avoid bankruptcy now has a market cap of over $70 billion. The founders still have one of the original air mattresses.
