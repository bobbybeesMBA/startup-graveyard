## The Story

In February 2005, three former PayPal employees registered a domain and launched a video platform with one specific purpose: helping people find dates. The idea was simple — instead of writing a boring text profile, you'd upload a video of yourself describing what you were looking for in a partner. Think Tinder, but in 2005, and with webcam-quality footage of strangers nervously listing their hobbies.

The slogan was "Tune In, Hook Up." The founders even offered to pay women $20 to upload videos of themselves to the platform, because nobody was using it. Literally nobody. The dating concept was a ghost town.

But something interesting happened. People started uploading videos that had nothing to do with dating — random clips, comedy sketches, their cats. The founders noticed that users didn't want a video dating service. They wanted somewhere to put *any* video on the internet. So they ripped out the dating features, opened the floodgates, and within 18 months sold the company to Google for $1.65 billion. The dating site slogan was quietly buried. No one mourned it.
