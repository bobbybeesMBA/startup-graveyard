## The Story

A chemist at a large American corporation was trying to develop a super-strong adhesive for use in aerospace manufacturing. He needed something that could bond airplane components under extreme conditions. Instead, he produced the opposite: an adhesive so weak that it barely stuck to anything. You could press paper to a surface and peel it right off. Cleanly. Repeatedly. It was, by the standards of his assignment, a complete failure.

The "failed" adhesive sat unused for years. Then a colleague had a problem: the bookmarks he used in his church hymnal kept falling out. He remembered the pathetically weak glue, applied some to small strips of paper, and stuck them in his book. They held the page. They peeled off without damage. They could be repositioned endlessly.

The first commercial test was a disaster — the company gave out free samples in four cities and almost nobody reordered. Then they tried a different approach: in one test city, they handed the product directly to office workers and let them use it for a week. Ninety percent of those workers said they'd buy it. The issue had never been the product — it was that people couldn't understand a weak adhesive until they held one. A glue too weak for airplanes became one of the most ubiquitous office supplies in history. Over 50 billion of those little sticky notes have been sold.
