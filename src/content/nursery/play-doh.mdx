## The Story

This isn't a tech company, but it might be the greatest pivot in consumer product history, and it deserves its spot in the nursery.

In the 1930s, a company called Kutol Products manufactured a soft, pliable putty designed to remove the black soot that coal-burning heaters left on wallpaper. It worked great. And for two decades, it sold steadily. Then America switched from coal to oil and gas heating. The soot disappeared. The product was suddenly useless. The company was dying.

Then a schoolteacher — the sister-in-law of one of the company's executives — mentioned to the family that she'd been using the wall cleaner as modeling clay in her classroom. The kids loved squishing it. It was soft, non-toxic, and didn't dry out as fast as regular clay.

The company reformulated slightly, added colors and a pleasant smell, rebranded as a children's toy, and started selling to schools and toy stores. Hasbro now owns the brand. Over two billion cans have been sold worldwide. A failing coal-era wall cleaner became one of the most iconic toys in history because one teacher let her students play with cleaning supplies.
