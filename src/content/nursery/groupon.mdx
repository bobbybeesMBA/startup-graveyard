## The Story

In 2007, a 27-year-old named Andrew Mason built a platform called The Point. The concept was noble: get groups of people to pledge toward collective causes — environmental campaigns, social justice initiatives, community projects — that would only activate once a critical mass of supporters committed. Crowdfunding for activism, basically.

It went basically nowhere. The causes were vague, the traction was minimal, and the platform was struggling to find users who cared enough to actually do anything.

Then someone posted a campaign with a decidedly un-noble cause: getting a group discount on a product. A bunch of people who wanted to buy the same thing banded together to negotiate a bulk price. Mason noticed that *this* was the behavior that lit up the platform. Not saving the whales. Saving 40% on a restaurant meal.

So he pivoted the entire company around group buying and daily deals. The activist petition site became the fastest company in history to reach a $1 billion valuation. It was offered a $6 billion acquisition by Google and turned it down (that part aged poorly). But the pivot itself — from altruism to coupons — remains one of the most hilarious genre shifts in startup history.
