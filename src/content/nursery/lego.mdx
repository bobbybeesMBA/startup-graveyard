## The Story

In 1916, a carpenter in the tiny Danish town of Billund bought a local woodworking shop. For years, he built doors, windows, and furniture for the farming community. Then the Great Depression hit and nobody was buying cabinets. Desperate for income, he started making something cheaper and easier to sell: small wooden toys.

The toys were charming — little pull-along ducks, miniature cars, yo-yos. In 1935, he named the company after the Danish phrase "leg godt," meaning "play well." The wooden toy business held steady through World War II, but in 1942, a factory fire destroyed most of the inventory. He rebuilt. Then another fire in 1960. He rebuilt again. (Danish carpenters are apparently indestructible.)

The real pivot came after the war, when the company purchased one of the first plastic injection molding machines in Denmark. In 1949, they produced their first "Automatic Binding Bricks" — small plastic blocks that could click together. The early versions were crude. They didn't hold well. But by 1958, the interlocking design was perfected. A child could build anything. An adult could too, and increasingly did.

The wooden duck workshop became the largest toy company on Earth, overtaking Mattel in 2014. The tiny bricks have generated more creative joy — and more barefoot agony — than perhaps any product in human history. It all started with a carpenter who couldn't sell cabinets.
