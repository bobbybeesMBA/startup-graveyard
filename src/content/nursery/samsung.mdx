## The Story

In 1938, a young Korean entrepreneur named Lee Byung-chul opened a small trading company in Taegu with about $27 in today's equivalent. His business? Exporting locally produced dried fish, vegetables, and noodles to China and Japan. The company name translated roughly to "three stars" — meant to symbolize something big, numerous, and powerful.

The noodle business grew modestly. Over the next two decades, the company expanded into flour milling, confectionery, insurance, and textiles. It was a sprawling but unremarkable Korean conglomerate — the kind that made sugar and wove fabric and did whatever was profitable in a rapidly developing post-war economy.

Then, in 1969, the company made a bet that changed everything: electronics. It produced its first black-and-white television. Then semiconductors. Then memory chips. Then monitors. Then mobile phones. Each decade, the company moved further from dried fish and closer to the bleeding edge of technology.

Today, the three-star noodle exporter manufactures roughly one in five smartphones sold on Earth, produces the chips inside many of its competitors' devices, and builds the screens you're probably reading this on. From dried fish to the Galaxy. Sometimes the pivot takes 30 years, and that's fine.
