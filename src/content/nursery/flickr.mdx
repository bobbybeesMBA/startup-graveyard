## The Story

A small team in Vancouver built an online role-playing game where players could interact, trade items, and explore a shared world. It was creative, community-driven, and never quite found its audience. But the game had one feature that players latched onto unexpectedly: the ability to share photos within the game environment.

The photo-sharing tool was meant to be a minor social feature — a way for players to personalize their experience. But the team noticed people were using it way more than the actual game. Some users were logging in *just* to share and browse photos, ignoring the RPG entirely.

The founders made the call: kill the game, build out the photo-sharing tool into its own product. They stripped the gaming elements and launched a standalone photography platform. Yahoo acquired it for somewhere between $22-$35 million in 2005. It became one of the defining photography communities of the Web 2.0 era. The same founder would later repeat this exact pattern — build a game, watch it fail, notice the side tool people actually use — when his next game, Glitch, produced Slack. Some people are just destined to succeed at the thing they weren't trying to build.
